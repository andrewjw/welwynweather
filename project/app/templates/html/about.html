<p>The weather station we use is made by <a href="http://smartweather.co.uk/product.php?productid=16144&cat=249&page=1">Smart Weather</a> and we read the data using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pywws/">PyWWS</a>. It measures indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, pressure and it has rain guage.</p>

<p>The weather station used is not a scientific instrument and it has not be calibrated or properly mounted so that data should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>On 12<sup>th</sup> April 2017 we moved about half a mile. The weather station was remounted so the stats before and after this date are not directly comparable. Temperature, pressure and rain should be reasonable close but there will be a significant discontinuity with wind.</p>
